xxmaj he 's in this movie somewhere , but we only know what the movie tells us . xxmaj this is by far the film 's biggest flaw . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is n't so much a character but a xxunk - xxunk ball , xxunk between scenes with xxmaj judy and his xxmaj grandmother , but we never get to know who xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas really is . xxmaj this is important because as xxmaj i 've mentioned the only thing we know of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is that he 's a sexually active teenager with a xxunk the size of xxmaj manhattan . xxmaj he 's a total xxmaj xxunk - male . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all . xxmaj why should anyone ? xxmaj so by the end of the movie , in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas has attained xxup any depth and learned the errors of his ways ? xxmaj how could such a two - dimensional character have any depth ? xxmaj if only the director had worried a little more about xxunk out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand - held shot . \\n\\n xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas brings to life the world of the xxmaj latino inner - city neighborhood to the big screen . xxmaj something that few films have done before in the past . xxmaj the film has been xxunk for feeling so real , and i wo n't \\n\\n argue with that . i have n't seen this level of reality since xxup xxunk aired xxmaj survivor . xxmaj seriously , although the movie has some nice shots of the city , the writer / director xxmaj peter xxmaj sollett was way too xxunk on close - ups and hand - held shots . xxmaj this problem is particularly noticed in xxunk scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep - breathing xxunk to keep from passing out . xxmaj as the film continues , the shots get tighter and tighter with faces xxunk from xxunk to xxunk on the screen ; you can practically xxunk xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas 's cheap xxunk . xxmaj the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast . xxmaj the xxunk scenes of inner - city apartments make them look small and xxunk , which is not true . xxmaj i 've been in those type apartments ; i used to live in one . xxmaj they 're not xxunk but they have high xxunk and they 're decent living xxunk . xxmaj by the movie 's standards you 'd think that these apartments were xxunk xxunk of xxunk - and - xxunk , xxunk paint and xxunk walls . xxmaj unfortunately , xxmaj sollett 's constant use of close - ups and one particularly bad shot with a xxunk - in on one scene come off as totally amateurish . xxmaj but xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is only xxmaj sollett 's second film , and his most well known , a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films . xxmaj one review i read xxunk the movie as , ` ethnicity for xxmaj ethnicity 's xxmaj sake , ' and i can not agree more . xxmaj if xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas were truly a great film and story , then the characters ' xxunk would n't matter whether they were xxmaj latino , xxmaj chinese , etc . xxmaj yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle - class xxunk with a bunch of xxunk - xxunk white kids the results would n't be such glowing reviews , and we 'd see the film 's flaws more clearly . xxmaj indeed , some other aspects of the use of xxmaj latinos in this film bother me . xxmaj while some aspects of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas are accurate others i have to question . xxmaj for example , xxmaj victor , xxmaj nino and xxmaj vicky all share the same room to sleep . xxmaj this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe . xxmaj any self - xxunk xxmaj latino family would n't have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen - year old girl . xxmaj at first i was xxunk , perhaps i was wrong , but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified . xxmaj considering how conservative the grandmother is , you 'd think that xxmaj vicky would have been sleeping in her room . \\n\\n xxmaj as a xxmaj latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative xxmaj cuban household , raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full - time , i could relate to the movie in many ways , which is why my critical xxunk are xxunk because i really wanted to love this movie . xxmaj unfortunately , my lack of respect for xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas xxunk my feelings for the film . xxmaj maybe it 's because xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk when i was xxunk . xxmaj maybe it 's because without any further xxunk by the film , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is merely a stereotypical hot - blooded xxmaj latino , who 'll just end up shouting to girls from his car , ` hey bay - xxunk , xxunk want to get into my xxunk xxunk - xxunk ? ' xxmaj either way i do n't like him , so ultimately how can i like a film about him ? xxmaj so if you 'll excuse me , xxmaj i 'm going to go stick my hands into a bowl of xxunk .</td>\n",

) fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through xxup xxunk xxmaj box xxunk . xxmaj this would be a pretty thin xxunk to base an entire film on , except that xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner is xxunk xxunk - out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters , from the xxunk but lonely xxmaj hugo xxmaj matuschek ( frank xxmaj morgan ) himself , who learns that his shop really is his home ; xxmaj xxunk ( felix xxmaj xxunk ) , xxmaj kralik 's sidekick and friend who always xxunk out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion ; xxunk pimp - du - xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( joseph xxmaj xxunk ) who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a xxunk righteous xxmaj kralik ; and ambitious xxunk boy xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( william xxmaj tracy ) who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of xxunk for xxmaj matuschek &amp; xxmaj co. xxmaj the xxunk love story between ' dear xxmaj friends ' is played out in this little shop in xxmaj budapest , xxmaj hungary , in which xxmaj kralik 's xxunk xxunk and subsequent xxunk to shop manager help the two xxunk - to - be along . xxmaj it 's nice that everyone gets a story in this film ; the supporting characters are well - developed , and xxmaj matuschek 's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one xxmaj alfred and xxmaj clara share . xxmaj his xxunk to new xxunk boy xxmaj xxunk ( charles xxmaj smith ) for xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve dinner , made in the xxunk , beautiful snow of a xxmaj hungarian winter , makes the audience glad that he is not alone ; we come to care even for the characters whose love story it is n't this film 's business to tell . \\n\\n xxmaj aside from the love story , i must say that xxmaj james xxmaj stewart is truly one of the best things about this film . xxmaj he does n't play the full - xxunk xxmaj jimmy xxmaj stewart persona in this film ( c / f ' mr xxmaj smith xxmaj goes xxmaj to xxmaj washington ' for that ) ; in fact xxmaj alfred xxmaj kralik is xxunk and abrupt and not particularly kind . xxmaj he 's rather a xxunk man , in fact , with little hint ( until , perhaps , the very end ) of the xxunk - xxunk down - home xxunk charm xxmaj stewart would soon come to xxunk . xxmaj when he finds out before xxmaj clara that they have been xxunk in secret , in fact , xxmaj kralik does n't ' xxunk up -- he xxunk it out to see how far he can take the xxunk , especially since he quickly realises ( given his stormy relationship with xxmaj clara as boss and xxunk ) that loving the person he knows through the xxunk letters might not xxunk with loving the person herself . xxmaj his description to xxmaj clara of the fictional xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( what a name ! ) who was to become her xxunk is hilarious in the extreme , but also his way of proving that the letters do n't reveal all there is to a man , just as her letters do n't reveal all there is to her . xxmaj stewart plays this role perfectly -- he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever xxmaj clara insults xxmaj mr . xxmaj kralik , as she is often wo nt to do , even ( and especially ) to his face . xxmaj and yet one believes , underneath the xxunk and xxunk , that he * could * reveal his identity with as much xxunk and xxunk and sheer * hope * as he eventually does . \\n\\n xxmaj special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well . xxmaj margaret xxmaj xxunk xxunk rather less well in the first half of the film , but she really comes into her own in the closing - shop scene on xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve , when she almost gets her heart broken again by xxmaj alfred 's most vivid description of her xxunk xxunk . xxmaj frank xxmaj morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous xxmaj hugo xxmaj matuschek driven to nervous breakdown , the man who has to xxunk his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to ' grow old with him ' . xxmaj and xxmaj felix xxmaj xxunk plays the role of the meek but xxunk xxmaj xxunk wonderfully ( a xxmaj lubitsch regular , since he appears as a hilarious xxmaj russian xxunk in xxunk particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend xxmaj alfred get the xxmaj christmas present the latter * really * wants … a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box xxmaj clara is so hung up on . \\n\\n xxmaj xxunk xxmaj lubitsch really does himself proud with this film -- for example , the famously xxunk and xxunk care given to detail in the creation of the xxmaj matuschek shop is well worth the effort , right down to the xxmaj hungarian names on the door , the xxunk and the cash xxunk and so on . xxmaj but even though xxmaj lubitsch chose to have the story set in xxmaj hungary , the setting is actually universal : it could happen anywhere ; it could happen to you . xxmaj xxunk lies the charm of this simple story , these believable characters who really * are * people . xxmaj the snow on xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve is real as well , or at least as real as xxmaj lubitsch could make it ( he had snow machines brought in at great expense ) . xxmaj it is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable , that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that can not be xxunk . ( no , not even in a remake like xxup you 've xxup got xxup mail . ) \\n\\n * this * is really the xxmaj jimmy xxmaj stewart xxmaj christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about xxup it 's a xxup wonderful xxup life . xxmaj not to xxunk from the merits of that other film , but there 'd be no harm , and in fact a lot of good , done in watching xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner this xxmaj christmas instead . xxmaj it 's sweet , funny , charming , and xxmaj stewart is xxunk in his role . xxmaj we should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film ; the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could .</td>\n",

xxmaj very sad . \\n\\n xxmaj also , i just thought that xxmaj i d point something mentioned on the message xxunk which i felt was actually true : the straight men are all hotter than the gay guys . \\n\\n xxmaj do n't get me wrong , xxmaj i m not saying all the gay guys were ugly and boring , as a matter of fact i found some of them very cute . xxmaj it 's just that overall they were just xxup blah compared to the men you 'd see on shows like a xxmaj shot xxmaj at xxmaj love with xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk or xxmaj the xxmaj xxunk . \\n\\n i do n't know how many times i hit fast forward during this show . i can accept a lead character as interesting as a cardboard box , i can accept the xxunk , xxunk suitors but xxup please for the love of xxmaj god entertain me just a little . xxmaj no such luck . \\n\\n xxmaj if you 're expecting drama , intrigue , xxunk , or excitement you will be xxup severely disappointed . xxmaj the biggest \" drama \" comes from the fact that one of the suitors still may have a boyfriend in xxmaj new xxmaj york ( how xxunk ! ) . xxmaj as xxunk as that may be i guarantee you , that is the xxup only thing that remotely resembles any conflict on this show . \\n\\n xxmaj sure there is the twist , but if you have any semblance of xxmaj xxunk in you , you 'll easily xxunk who 's who ( it was n't hard at all , i was only wrong once . ) xxmaj this show is stacking so much of its xxunk on the twist that it fails to deliver anywhere else . \\n\\n xxmaj we get to watch as xxmaj james &amp; xxmaj co xxunk along such exciting activities such as learning how to xxmaj western step dance , shopping for xxunk , visiting a xxunk xxunk , and gay xxunk . xxup yawn . xxmaj sure you have the occasional topless dancing but who cares when everyone is boring anyway . xxmaj that 's one of main problems with the show : xxup no xxup one seems to be enjoying themselves -- they are there just going through the motion trying xxunk hard to appear to have a good time . xxmaj and you really ca nt blame them since the events are all wildly unimaginative and lame . \\n\\n xxmaj finally , the physical aspect is not there . xxmaj there 's no xxunk , no xxunk , no kissing ( ! ) , no xxunk of any sort . xxmaj it 's just \" ok that was a boring date , xxmaj i m gon na go back to my ugly , tacky wanna - be xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk dwelling ( quick xxunk on the lips ) xxup xxunk . \" xxmaj this show is so xxrep 4 * xxunk xxunk it 's ridiculous . i can understand them not wanting to play up the xxunk xxunk nature of homosexual men , but come the xxrep 4 * on . xxmaj people who watch reality xxup tv shows are gon na want more than xxunk xxunk and xxunk kisses . xxmaj this show refuses to compromise . \\n\\n xxmaj sorry if this was long winded but i felt these were issues that needed to be xxunk . i do commend xxmaj bravo for first putting up a show of this nature , but the xxunk incompetent manner in which this show was handled is mind xxunk . xxmaj to summarize my three points : xxmaj boring + xxmaj boring + xxmaj boring = go do something else . xxmaj you 'll have more fun waiting at a doctor 's office for an xxunk , at least they have interesting xxunk there .</td>\n",

              "      <td>xxbos xxmaj i 'm sure things did n't exactly go the same way in the real life of xxmaj homer xxmaj hickam as they did in the film adaptation of his book , xxmaj rocket xxmaj boys , but the movie \" october xxmaj sky \" ( an xxunk of the book 's title ) is good enough to stand alone . i have not read xxmaj hickam 's memoirs , but i am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation . xxmaj the film , directed by xxmaj joe xxmaj xxunk and written by xxmaj lewis xxmaj xxunk , xxunk the story of teenager xxmaj homer xxmaj hickam ( jake xxmaj xxunk ) , beginning in xxmaj october of 1957 . xxmaj it opens with the sound of a radio broadcast , bringing news of the xxmaj russian satellite xxmaj xxunk , the first artificial satellite in orbit . xxmaj we see a images of a blue - gray town and its people : mostly miners working for the xxmaj olga xxmaj coal xxmaj company . xxmaj one of the miners xxunk to the news on a hand - held radio as he enters the elevator xxunk , but the xxunk is lost as he disappears into the darkness , losing sight of the xxunk sky above him . a melancholy violin tune xxunk with this image . xxmaj we then get a xxunk of xxmaj xxunk on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting : xxmaj october 5 , 1957 , xxmaj coalwood , xxmaj west xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj homer and his buddies , xxmaj roy xxmaj lee xxmaj cook ( william xxmaj lee xxmaj scott ) and xxmaj xxunk o'dell ( chad xxmaj xxunk ) , are talking about football xxunk . xxmaj football xxunk are the only way out of the town , and working in the mines , for these boys . \" why are the xxunk the only ones who get to go to college , \" questions xxmaj homer . xxmaj roy xxmaj lee replies , \" they 're also the only ones who get the girls . \" xxmaj homer does n't make it in football like his older brother , so he is destined for the mines , and to follow in his father 's xxunk as mine xxunk . xxmaj until he sees the xxunk of light xxunk across the xxmaj october sky . xxmaj then he wants to build a rocket . \" i want to go into space , \" says xxmaj homer . xxmaj after a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother 's ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) xxunk , xxmaj homer xxunk the help of the nerdy xxmaj quentin xxmaj wilson ( chris xxmaj owen ) . xxmaj quentin asks xxmaj homer , \" what do you want to know about rockets ? \" xxmaj homer quickly xxunk , \" everything . \" xxmaj his science teacher at xxmaj big xxmaj xxunk xxmaj high xxmaj school , xxmaj miss xxmaj xxunk xxmaj riley ( laura xxmaj xxunk ) greatly supports xxmaj homer , and the four boys work on building rockets in xxmaj homer 's basement . xxmaj his father , however , whose life is the mine , does not support him . xxmaj john xxmaj hickam ( chris xxmaj cooper ) believes that xxmaj homer should n't waste his time on the rockets , that the coal mines are all that matter . xxmaj the coal from the mines is used to make steel , and without steel , the country would be nothing . xxmaj the difficult relationship between xxmaj homer and his dad is one of the most poignant relationships i have ever seen in a film . xxmaj miss xxmaj riley introduces xxmaj homer to the idea of entering the local science fair , with a chance to go the xxunk and win a college scholarship . \" you ca n't just dream your way out of xxmaj coalwood , \" she tells xxmaj homer . xxmaj homer and his friends act upon their dreams by working constantly on the rockets , xxunk the models with each attempt . xxmaj despite the many attempts , the boys do not lose their determination . \" what are the chances of us winning that science fair , \" o'dell asks xxmaj homer in one of their more xxunk moments . \" a million to one , \" answers xxmaj homer . \" that good ? \" o'dell replies , \" well , why did n't you say so ? \" xxmaj the music , composed by xxmaj mark xxmaj xxunk , conveys sadness and hope at the same time , especially sad at a point when xxmaj homer xxunk into the mine xxunk and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of xxmaj coalwood . xxmaj xxunk 1950s ' rock and roll , including songs by xxmaj the xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj buddy xxmaj xxunk , occasionally pushes the xxunk pieces aside to create a light - hearted mood that xxunk the teenagers ' lives with the lives of the miners . xxmaj the film , photographed by xxmaj fred xxmaj murphy , also uses colors to set xxunk and xxunk . xxmaj the town of xxmaj coalwood , actually filmed in xxmaj xxunk , is washed with blues , xxunk , and xxunk . xxmaj it 's as if the xxunk from the coal sticks to xxunk faces , clothes , houses , and roads . xxmaj when a couple in a xxunk red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys , it is obvious that they are from the world outside of xxmaj coalwood and the xxmaj olga xxmaj coal xxmaj company . xxmaj the book on xxunk xxunk design that xxmaj miss xxmaj riley gives xxmaj homer is red . xxmaj the red stands out enough against the blue - gray world of xxmaj coalwood to xxunk \" getting out \" , but it is still subtle . xxmaj the xxunk are xxunk hints of a world that xxmaj homer only dreams of . xxmaj jake xxmaj xxunk xxunk such xxunk , hope , and xxunk as xxmaj homer xxmaj hickam that it is hard to believe he is n't the real xxmaj homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film . xxmaj chris xxmaj cooper is also xxunk believable as xxmaj homer 's xxunk father , who does n't recognize , or just does n't want to admit , that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive . xxmaj homer , and everyone who encourages him in his rocket - building , is aware that the town is dying . xxmaj with the community xxunk , the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys ' xxunk . xxmaj again , xxmaj i 'm sure things did n't happen exactly as the movie portrayed them , but what would a movie be without a bit of xxunk ? \" october xxmaj sky \" has just enough of that to make it a great motion picture and enough xxunk to keep it real .</td>\n",
